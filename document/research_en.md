This is just a scribbled note in order to develop android apps.

# ON INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
I feel React Native, progressive web apps or Android Studio is better than Visual Studio (and Xamarin). The reason is just Visual Studio has restrictions. React Native or progressive web apps is better if readers are familiar with web development and the app is not really complex. Otherwise, Android Studio is better.

## NATIVE ANDROID
Native android development means that an app is targeting only Android not iOS. There are the two following IDEs.

- Android Studio
    - code: Java / Kotlin
- Visual Studio (VS)

VS has some restrictions for commercial use so Android Studio would be better.

## Cross-platform
Cross-platform development means that an app would work on both Android and iOS. The whole codes might not be the exact same, but mostly they are.

- Xamarin, which is one of the tools of VS
    - C#
- React Native
    - UI code: JavaScript
    - logic code: JavaScript
- Progressive web apps (PWA)
    - UI code: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    - logic code: JavaScript
